to run on localhost:

* (package manager) install node
* (package manager) install npm
* npm install node-static
* npm install coffee-script
* cake build
* node run.node.js
* navigate to localhost:8080

some notes on coffeescript:
* cake build outputs app.js to lib/
* when you make a new .coffee file in src, you must add it to the list in Cakefile. 
    (cake build concatenates the .coffee files in the order specified before compiling. 
    the output of a coffeescript compile is all held in one closure, so in order for 
    the scripts to interact, they must be concatenated first.)
* index.html should <script> include all library js files before app.js

documentation:
*inline markdown documentation of methods. this allows docco to generate nice docs.
