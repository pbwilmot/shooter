to run on localhost:

* (package manager) install node
* (package manager) install npm
* npm install node-static
* npm install coffee-script
* cake build
* node run.node.js
* navigate to localhost:8080

some notes on coffeescript:
* when you make a new .coffee file in src, you must add it to the list in Cakefile. (cake build concatenates the .coffee files before compiling. the output of a coffeescript compile is all held in one closure, so in order for the scripts to interact, they must be concatenated first.)
* cake build outputs app.js to lib/
* index.html should <script> include all library js files before app.js
